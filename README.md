### Hi, I'm Dr. Samuel Factor

## About Me

I am a highly motivated researcher and problem-solver seeking to transition into the aerospace industry. I aim to leverage broad expertise in high-resolution space-based remote sensing, novel image processing algorithms, statistical data analysis, physical modeling, and optical & mechanical lab experience acquired through a Ph.D. in Astronomy. I am a quick learner with a proven ability to efficiently apply and effectively communicate new skills.

<!-- - üå± Currently learning: -->
- üî≠ Working on: Assessing strengths, weaknesses, and best practice observing strategies for JWST high-resolution kernel-phase imaging (using detection limit metrics) to maximize the yield of valuable telescope time.
- üåç Languages: (fluent) Python, bash, git, LaTeX, (familiar) C, SQL, Fortran, slurm, Mathematica
- üì´ How to reach me: [smfactor0@gmail.com](mailto:smfactor0@gmail.com)
- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I row crew and am an avid hiker / backpacker.

## Featured Projects üíª

### [Argus](https://github.com/smfactor/Argus)

**Argus** is a package enableing the extraction and modeling of kernel-phase data from high resolution imaging data. Tutorials are currently under construction.

### [Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of Binary Populations](https://github.com/smfactor/HBMBinaryPop)

**HBMBinaryPop** is a notebook which allows the user to fit a binary population model to detections and detection limits using hierarchical bayesian modeling.
